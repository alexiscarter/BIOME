```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

We'll work with the `GlobalPatterns` dataset from the phyloseq package.

```{r}
library(phyloseq); packageVersion("phyloseq")
data(GlobalPatterns)
GP <- GlobalPatterns # For shorthand
```

We've discussed the descriptors, accessors, subsetting and transformation available through phyloseq. Let's put those to work, and answer the following questions.

- How many samples from each sample type?
- How many OTUs have abundance > 100
- How many Phylum:Bacteroidetes OTUs were present in water samples?
- Which sample type had the highest amount of Genus:Escherichia?
- How many OTUs were present in 3+ samples?

Feel free to work on your own data as well.

Useful functions may include: `subset_samples`, `subset_taxa`, `prune_taxa`, `sample_sums`, `taxa_sums`, `ntaxa`, and more.
