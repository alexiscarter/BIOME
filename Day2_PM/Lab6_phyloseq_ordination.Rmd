```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

We'll work with the `GlobalPatterns` dataset from the phyloseq package.

```{r}
library(phyloseq); packageVersion("phyloseq")
data(GlobalPatterns)
GP <- GlobalPatterns # For shorthand
```

We've discussed the community distance/dissimilarity and ordination capabailities of phyloseq.

- Create an ordination of all the samples, colored by sample type.
- Create an ordination of just the water samples.
- How does an ordination based on the weighted unifrac distance compared to the unweighted unifrac?
- How about unifrac versus bray-curtis?
- How many dimensions are needed to capture the distances between these samples?
- Try a few different ordination methods.

Feel free to work on your own data as well.

Useful functions will include: `distance`, `ordinate`, `plot_ordination`, `plot_scree`, and more.
