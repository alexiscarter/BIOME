# R Update

We will mainly use two packages during this workshop: [DADA2](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/index.html) and [Phyloseq](https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/index.html). It is recommanded that you update your R software in order that these packages run smoothly. Indeed, in order to install DADA2, you must have R version 3.5.0 or newer, and Bioconductor version 3.7. Using Bioconductor is the easiest way to install both DADA2 and Phyloseq.



## For Windows users
```{r win, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("installr")
library(installr)
updateR()
```
What is nice with this package is that it should migrate the packages you've installed on your older version of R to the folder corresponding to the newest version of R. It also updates all the packages you've installed from the CRAN repository. 

## For Mac users
```{r mac, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)
install_github('andreacirilloac/updateR')
library(updateR)
updateR(admin_password = 'Admin user password')
```
In order to migrate your packages from your old version to the new one:
Follow this path:
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/
(/Biblioth√®que/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/) for the french speakers
Change the folder's name to the 3.5.1 (latest R version).

You then want to update your packages using this command.
```{r updatepack, eval=FALSE}
update.packages(checkBuilt=TRUE, ask=FALSE)
```
This will only update the packages installed from the CRAN repository.

In order to check if everything went according to plan:
```{r checkpack, eval=FALSE}
version
packageStatus()
```

## For Unix users

# Installing the packages

Now that you've got a brand new R, we're going to install DADA2 and Phyloseq. For that we must first install Bioconductor. 

```{r Bioconductor, eval=FALSE}
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R") # Installs Bionconductor
biocLite("dada2") # Installs DADA2 
biocLite("phyloseq") # Installs phyloseq 
```

If this doesn't work you can try other methods. Methods for [DADA2](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/dada-installation.html) and [Phyloseq](https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/install.html). <br>  If you don't succeed, we'll help you out on the first morning of the workshop.


# Getting information on a package or function

On R Studio you can type ?'name' or help('name)
For example:
```{r help , eval=FALSE}
library(dada2) # Loads the DADA2 package in the environment
?dada2 
?filterAndTrim # One of DADA2's functions
help(filterAndTrim)
```

If you're just using R, use ??'name'. It will open a page in your internet browser with the documentation on the function you want documentation on. 
```{r help2 , eval=FALSE}
library(dada2) # Loads the DADA2 package in the environment
??dada2
??filterAndTrim # One of DADA2's functions
```

You can also see the source code of a function by typing its name.
